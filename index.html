    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, I’m Nico, a computer science graduate with a Bachelor’s degree earned in 2021. After graduating, I took on non-technical roles to address financial responsibilities, which required me to step away from coding temporarily. Now that I’ve settled those challenges, I’m excited to return to my passion for programming and reignite my career in tech. </p>
     <p> During my time away, I developed strong problem-solving, adaptability, and teamwork skills that I believe will complement my technical abilities. I’ve been actively rebuilding my coding knowledge and working on projects to refresh my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript,C# and Unity. I’m also exploring modern technologies like React and Node.js to stay current with industry trends.</p>
      <p>I’m currently seeking opportunities to gain hands-on experience, contribute to meaningful projects, and grow as a developer. My goal is to leverage my education, newfound skills, and determination to build innovative solutions that make a difference. </p>
       <p>When I’m not coding, I enjoy watching movies , playing games, and listening to music. I believe that continuous learning and perseverance are key to success, and I’m committed to improving every day.Feel free to explore my projects below or reach out to me at Niconovriantosim@gmail.com . Let’s connect and build something amazing together!</p>
